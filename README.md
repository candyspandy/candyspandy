# Hi — I'm Spandan Kolhe 👋

I’m a freelance visual storyteller who blends photography, videography, IoT tinkering, and a bit of creative coding to craft memorable pieces. My focus is on capturing mood, light, and moments — whether that’s stills, motion, or small interactive experiments that enhance a project’s atmosphere.

## What I do

- Photography — portrait, lifestyle, and editorial work (personal and creative projects; I do not take commercial or large event bookings).
- Videography — cinematics, short films, promotional clips, and editing/color grading (focused on creative and independent projects rather than commercial/event coverage).
- IoT projects — prototyping connected devices, sensor-driven installations, and hardware-driven visuals that tie physical interactions to media.
- Creative coding & “vibe” experiments — small generative visuals, interactive pieces, and ambient web experiences that complement my visual work (used sparingly to enhance projects, not the main focus).

## Portfolio

My main body of work lives in my portfolio: https://www.behance.net/spandankolhe. I organize projects by:
- Featured projects (best work / recent favorites)
- Photography galleries (collections and series)
- Video reels (short cuts, full pieces, behind-the-scenes)
- IoT & physical projects (showcasing prototypes, installations, and documentation)

## Notes

- I enjoy adding subtle generative or interactive elements and hardware-driven experiences when they serve the mood of a project, but most of my work centers on photography and videography for creative projects.
- I do not accept commercial shoots or event coverage — I focus on personal, editorial, and art-focused commissions.
- If you found this repo helpful or want to work together, say hi — I reply faster to clear project briefs.
